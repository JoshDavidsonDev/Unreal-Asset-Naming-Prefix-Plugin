# Unreal-Asset-Naming-Prefix-Plugin
Asset Naming Prefix is an Unreal Engine plugin that enforces asset naming conventions by automatically prefixing new or existing assets based on a user-defined DataTable. Configure via Project Settings (toggle auto-prefixing, set paths, view logs) or manually apply prefixes from the Content Browser.
